  <description>Remove mood penalties from "innocent prisoner died" now labelled "prisoner died" and also from "prisoner was sold".
Bonus: Hilariously ironic description for the moods that now are only thoughts with 0 mood effect.
  Disclaimer: (Penalties for butchering, euthanizing, removing organs, killed by organ harvest and other sorts of stuff remains) BUT HEY! You can still cut the legs right? -Right! And Left!
